      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I'm Devin, an aspiring web developer. I built this site in an effort to teach myself about webpage design, fonts, and to gain a wider understanding of CSS. I make my own cold-brew coffee, and I build computers for friends and
        family.</p>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I started learning to code at the age of 13 because I wanted to learn how to make video games on my TI-83 calculator. Early on, I would experiment by modifying video games. Over time, I have gained experience
          through programming courses and by developing my own personal websites.</p>

        <h3>Custom PC Builds</h3>
        <p class="pc-skill-description">Growing up, I had always taken an interest in technology, the internet and PC gaming. On my 18th birthday, I had finally amassed the funds to construct my own gaming rig. From that moment on, coming up with and
          implementing PC builds has
          been a big passion of mine. I often help friends and family when it comes to building their own rigs.</p>
